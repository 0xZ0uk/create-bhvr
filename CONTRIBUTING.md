## Repo Structure

`create-bhvr` is a CLI tool that generates full-stack TypeScript projects using the Bun + Hono + Vite + React (BHVR) stack. The tool scaffolds projects from GitHub templates and allows users to add various extensions like TanStack Query, React Router, and more.

### How Extensions Work

Extensions in create-bhvr follow a modular architecture where each extension has:

1. **An Installer** (`src/installers/*.ts`) that handles:
   - Adding dependencies via `addPackageDependency()`
   - Copying appropriate template files using the `nameGenerator()` utility
   - Managing configuration changes

2. **Template variants** (`src/templates/extras/`) that provide:
   - Pre-configured code for different extension combinations
   - File variants named using a convention like `App-with-rpc-tailwind-tanstackquery.tsx`
   - Smart file selection based on enabled options

#### Adding New Extensions

To add a new extension (e.g., "myextension"):

1. **Create the installer** (`src/installers/myextension.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export const myExtensionInstaller = async (options: Required<ProjectOptions>) => {
     // Install dependencies
     await addPackageDependency({
       dependencies: ["my-package"],
       target: "client",
       projectName: options.projectName,
     });

     // Copy appropriate template files
     const selectedTemplate = nameGenerator("App.tsx", {
       myExtension: options.myExtension,
       // ... other options
     });
   };
   ```

2. **Add template variants** in `src/templates/extras/client/src/`:
   - Create files like `App-with-myextension.tsx`
   - Support all possible combinations like `App-with-myextension-tailwind.tsx`

3. **Update types** (`src/types.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export type ProjectOptions = {
     // ... existing options
     myExtension?: boolean;
   };
   ```

4. **Update the name generator logic** (`src/utils/name-generator.ts`) if needed for special naming rules.

#### Template File Naming Convention

The `nameGenerator()` utility creates file names based on enabled options:
- Base file: `App.tsx`
- With TanStack Query: `App-with-tanstackquery.tsx`
- Multiple extensions: `App-with-rpc-tailwind-tanstackquery.tsx`

Options are sorted alphabetically to ensure consistent naming.

#### Updating GitHub Actions

To make sure your new addition to extensions work, please add your combination to `.github/workflows/test-cli-options.yml` to make sure it does not break other builds. In order to do this you need to add your combination to the matrix and make sure a flag is included in `src/index.ts`.
